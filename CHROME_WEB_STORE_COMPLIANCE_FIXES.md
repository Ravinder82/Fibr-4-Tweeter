# Chrome Web Store Compliance Fixes

## Status: Ready for Implementation

This document outlines the required fixes based on past rejection emails to ensure Chrome Web Store compliance.

---

## 1. Privacy Policy (Violation: Purple Nickel) ✅ CRITICAL

### Issue
- Privacy policy link is broken or unavailable
- Chrome Web Store requires a publicly accessible privacy policy for extensions handling user data

### Required Actions
1. **Host Privacy Policy**
   - Create a public-facing privacy policy page
   - Options:
     - GitHub Pages: `https://ravinder82.github.io/fibr-privacy-policy`
     - Dedicated domain: `https://fibr.app/privacy`
     - GitHub raw file (not recommended): Use GitHub Pages instead

2. **Update manifest.json**
   ```json
   {
     "homepage_url": "https://github.com/Ravinder82/Fibr-4-Tweeter",
     "privacy_policy": "https://ravinder82.github.io/fibr-privacy-policy"
   }
   ```

3. **Privacy Policy Content** (Already in extension at `src/extension/modules/privacy-policy.js`)
   - Extract the content from privacy-policy.js module
   - Create a standalone HTML page
   - Ensure it covers:
     - Data collection (API keys stored locally)
     - No personal data transmission
     - Direct Gemini API communication
     - No third-party tracking
     - Open source transparency

### Implementation Steps
```bash
# 1. Create GitHub Pages branch
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .
echo "<!DOCTYPE html><html>..." > index.html
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add privacy policy page"
git push origin gh-pages

# 2. Update manifest.json with privacy_policy URL
# 3. Test the URL is publicly accessible
```

## 2. Remotely Hosted Code (Violation: Blue Argon) ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue
- Including remotely hosted code in Manifest V3 extension
- Specifically: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdfobject/2.1.1/pdfobject.min.js`

### Status: **RESOLVED** ✅
- Searched codebase - no remote script references found
- All dependencies are bundled locally
- `marked.min.js` is included in `src/extension/modules/marked.min.js`
- No dynamic script injection detected

### Verification
```bash
# Confirmed no remote scripts:
grep -r "https://cdn" src/extension/
grep -r "https://cdnjs" src/extension/
grep -r "pdfobject" src/extension/
# All returned no results
```

## 3. Impersonation & Branding (Violation: Red Nickel) ⚠️ NEEDS REVIEW

### Issue
- Extension was flagged for impersonating "Metamask" through icon/branding
- Must ensure unique branding that doesn't resemble other products

### Current Status
- Extension name: **Fibr** (unique)
- Icons located in: `icons/` directory
- Current icons: `icon16.png`, `icon32.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.jpeg`, `fibr.svg`

### Required Actions
1. **Review Icon Design**
   - Ensure icons don't resemble Metamask (fox logo) or other popular extensions
   - Current icon appears to be custom - verify it's original artwork
   - If using any third-party assets, ensure proper licensing

2. **Verify Branding Elements**
   - Extension name: "Fibr" ✅ (unique)
   - Description: Must not claim affiliation with other brands
   - Screenshots: Ensure no third-party branding visible
   - Promotional materials: Original artwork only

3. **Manifest Metadata Check**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Fibr - AI Twitter Content Generator",
     "description": "Generate viral Twitter posts from any webpage using AI",
     "icons": {
       "16": "icons/icon16.png",
       "32": "icons/icon32.png",
       "48": "icons/icon48.png",
       "128": "icons/icon128.jpeg"
     }
   }
   ```

### Action Items
- [ ] Review `icons/icon128.jpeg` - ensure it's original artwork
- [ ] Check all promotional materials for third-party branding
- [ ] Verify no trademarked terms in description/name
- [ ] Ensure screenshots show only Fibr UI

---

## 4. Additional Compliance Checklist

### Permissions Justification
Document why each permission is needed:

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",    // Read webpage content for AI analysis
    "storage",      // Store API keys and user preferences locally
    "scripting"     // Inject content extraction scripts
  ],
  "host_permissions": []  // No host permissions needed
}
```

### Data Disclosure Requirements
For Chrome Web Store listing:
- ✅ No personal data collected
- ✅ API keys stored locally only
- ✅ Direct communication with Google Gemini API
- ✅ No third-party analytics or tracking
- ✅ Open source code available for audit

### Content Security Policy
Ensure manifest has proper CSP:
```json
{
  "content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'"
  }
}
```
