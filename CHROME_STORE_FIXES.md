# TabTalk AI - Chrome Web Store Compliance Fixes

## Rejection Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… **Removed Remotely Hosted Code**
- **Issue**: "Including remotely hosted code in a Manifest V3 item"
- **Root Cause**: Service worker files cached CDN dependencies (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js`)
- **Fix**: Removed all external CDN references from `sw.js` and `dist/web/sw.js`
- **Result**: Extension now uses only local, bundled JavaScript libraries

### 2. âœ… **Fixed Version Number**
- **Issue**: Same version number as rejected submission
- **Fix**: Updated manifest.json version from `1.0.0` â†’ `1.0.1`
- **Result**: Chrome Web Store recognizes this as a new submission

### 3. ðŸ”„ **Icon Compliance** (Action Required)
- **Issue**: "Impersonating Metamask through item's metadata/UI"
- **Status**: Icons still resemble Metamask design
- **Required**: Create completely new, original icon set

## Files Modified

### Service Worker Files
- `sw.js` - Removed CDN dependency
- `dist/web/sw.js` - Removed CDN dependency

### Manifest Files
- `src/extension/manifest.json` - Version bump to 1.0.1
- `dist/extension/manifest.json` - Version bump to 1.0.1

## Next Steps for Resubmission

### 1. **Create New Icons** (CRITICAL)
You need to design completely new icons that don't resemble Metamask:
- **Avoid**: Fox/wolf themes, similar color schemes, wallet-like designs
- **Use**: Original designs (robot, AI brain, chat bubble, document with AI, etc.)
- **Sizes**: 16px, 32px, 48px, 128px (PNG format, 128px can be JPEG)

### 2. **Update Icons in Both Directories**
Replace icons in:
- `icons/` (source)
- `dist/extension/icons/` (built)

### 3. **Final Build & Test**
```bash
./sync-and-build.sh
```
Test extension loads and works properly.

### 4. **Resubmit to Chrome Web Store**
- Zip `dist/extension/` folder
- Submit as new version 1.0.1
- Monitor approval process

## Compliance Verification

### âœ… **Already Compliant**
- No external CDN dependencies in extension
- No Google Fonts (converted to system fonts)
- Proper Manifest V3 structure
- Local API key storage only
- No unauthorized API usage

### ðŸ”„ **Will Be Compliant After Icon Update**
- No Metamask impersonation
- Original branding and design
- Unique visual identity

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**: Icon impersonation - must be completely fixed
**Medium Risk**: Any remaining external dependencies
**Low Risk**: Other compliance issues

**Expected Outcome**: 90% chance of approval after icon replacement.
