---

### E. Thread vs Post Content

**Test Case 12: Thread Content**

- ✅ Each card shows: "Tweet 1/5", character count, content
- ✅ Click "Copy" → Get formatted thread with separators

## Console Check

Open Developer Tools (F12) and check console:

**Should NOT see:**
- ❌ `closeActiveModal error:`
- ❌ `Cannot read property of null`
- ❌ `Modal already exists`
- ❌ `Event handler not removed`

**Should see (optional):**
- ℹ️ Normal Fibr logs
- ℹ️ Gallery render messages

---

## Performance Check

**Memory Leak Test:**
1. Open and close modals 20 times
2. Open DevTools → Performance/Memory tab
3. ✅ No continuous memory growth
4. ✅ Garbage collection happens normally

**DOM Cleanup Test:**
1. Open DevTools → Elements tab
2. Open modal → Inspect → See `<div class="gallery-modal" data-gallery-modal="true">`
3. Close modal → **VERIFY**: Element removed from DOM
4. Open another modal → **VERIFY**: Only ONE modal element in DOM

---

## What Was Fixed?

### Before (Broken) ❌
```
1. Click "Edit" from Read modal
2. setTimeout delays the close operation
3. Edit modal starts creating
4. BOTH modals visible at same time
5. User sees overlapping modals (confusing!)
```

### After (Fixed) ✅
```
1. Click "Edit" from Read modal
2. destroyAllModals() runs immediately
3. Read modal removed from DOM
4. 50ms clean transition delay
5. Edit modal creates fresh
6. Only ONE modal ever visible
```

## Key Architecture Changes

### Old System
- Used `_activeModal` global state
- Used `setTimeout` for transitions (race conditions)
- Incomplete cleanup
- Event handlers leaked

### New System
- Uses `data-gallery-modal="true"` attribute
- `destroyAllModals()` finds and removes ALL modals
- Event handlers stored on modal element itself
- Clean 50ms transition delay
- Bulletproof cleanup

---

## Success Criteria

Your gallery modal system is working correctly if:

1. ✅ **No visual conflicts**: Never see two modals at once
2. ✅ **Smooth transitions**: Read → Edit feels instant and smooth
3. ✅ **Clean closes**: All close methods work perfectly
4. ✅ **No errors**: Console is clean during all operations
5. ✅ **Memory safe**: No leaks after repeated use
6. ✅ **Content accurate**: Threads and posts display correctly
7. ✅ **Edits save**: Changes persist after save
8. ✅ **Cancels discard**: Changes discarded after cancel

---

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see two modals:
1. Hard refresh the extension (remove and reload)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check you're using `dist/extension/` folder (not `src/`)

### If modals don't close:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify `destroyAllModals()` is being called
3. Check no other code is creating modals

### If content looks wrong:
1. Verify thread parsing is working
2. Check `FibrTwitter.parseTwitterThread()` is available
3. Inspect modal HTML in DevTools
