grep -r '\beval\s*(' . --include="*.js" --exclude="*.min.js"

## Extension Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Background Service Worker** (`background.js`)
   - Handles API communication with Google Gemini
   - Manages extension lifecycle

2. **Popup Interface** (`popup.html`, `popup.js`)
   - Main user interface
   - Chat interaction
   - Content generation controls

3. **Content Script** (`content.js`)
   - Extracts webpage content
   - Runs only when user activates extension

4. **Feature Modules:**
   - `api.js` - Gemini API integration
   - `storage.js` - Local data management
   - `export.js` - Chat export (Markdown/Text only)
   - `twitter.js` - Social media content generation
   - `ui-render.js` - UI rendering and interactions

### Data Flow

```
User Action → Popup → Background Worker → Gemini API
                ↓                              ↓
         Content Script              Response Processing
                ↓                              ↓
         Page Content  →  → → → →  → →    UI Update
```

All data processing occurs **locally** within the extension. API calls go directly to Google Gemini (user's own API key).

## Privacy & Data Handling

### What Data is Accessed:
- ✅ Webpage content (only when user clicks extension)
- ✅ User chat history (stored locally per domain)
- ✅ User's Gemini API key (stored locally)

### What Data is NOT Accessed:
- ❌ Browser history
- ❌ Cookies
- ❌ Passwords
