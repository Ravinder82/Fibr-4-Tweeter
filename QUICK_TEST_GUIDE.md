### Step 2: Test the Main Fix
1. Navigate to **any article** (e.g., news website, blog post)

5. **✅ Expected**: Tone selector modal opens without errors

## 🚨 If You Still See Issues

### Issue: "Failed to load page content"
**Cause**: Protected page or permission denied  
**Solution**: Try on a regular webpage (not chrome://, chrome-extension://, or Chrome Web Store)

### Issue: "Unsupported page protocol"
**Cause**: Not an HTTP/HTTPS page  
**Solution**: Navigate to a regular website

### Issue: Content loads but quick actions still fail
**Cause**: Extension cache issue  
**Solution**:
1. Remove extension completely
2. Reload page in Chrome
3. Re-install extension from `dist/extension/` folder
4. Set up API key again

## 📊 Technical Details

### What Changed (For Developers)

#### 1. Init Now Loads Content
```javascript
// popup.js line 113
if (this.apiKey) {
    this.showView("chat");
    await this.getAndCachePageContent(); // ✅ NEW: Loads content immediately
}
```

#### 2. Defensive Checks Added
```javascript
// Every quick action button now has:
await this.ensurePageContentLoaded(); // ✅ NEW: Safety net
```

#### 3. Smart Helper Method
```javascript
// New method: ensurePageContentLoaded()
// - Checks if content already loaded (fast)
// - Validates API key
// - Attempts load if needed
// - Returns true/false for success
```

## 🎓 Why This Fix Is Robust

### Multi-Layer Protection
```
Layer 1: Init loads content automatically
   ↓
Layer 2: Smart helper with caching + validation
   ↓
Layer 3: Button-level safety checks
   ↓
Result: 3 independent ways to ensure content is loaded
```

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ First time user (API setup flow)
- ✅ Returning user (automatic load)
- ✅ Content already loaded (cached)
- ✅ Protected pages (clear error)
- ✅ Network failures (retry guidance)
- ✅ Extension reload during use (recovery)
